This project was built for **Diesta**, the club that manages the interdepartmental competitions at IIT Hyderabad. Our team of six worked together to create a platform for **live event updates and result management** during the fest.

A fun behind-the-scenes fact: we initially planned to include a **livestreaming feature for matches**, and even started building it — but had to scrap the idea due to some technical constraints. If you peek into the GitHub repo, you’ll still find traces of that original plan.

To make things super organizer-friendly, we used **Excel sheets as the backend data source**, keeping it low-code and accessible. The site was hosted on **Netlify**, and I handled **domain setup** and **SEO optimization**.

In fact, if you Google _“Diesta IITH”_, our website ranks _above_ the Instagram page — which felt like a huge W 🚀
