This was our final project for the DBMS course at IIT Hyderabad — the requirement was to build a database-backed web app, but my team and I went all out.

We built a **complete cricket tournament manager** with:

- **Role-based access control** (admins, scorers, viewers)
- **Live score updates**
- **Match scheduling & team management**
- A full **admin portal** to oversee the tournament

The biggest technical learning was working with a **large, scalable database** and optimizing the structure to handle real-world usage. I also focused on improving the UI/UX — making it smooth, intuitive, and responsive.

It was a team effort, and one of my favorite builds because it turned something academic into something _actually usable_.
