As part of **Lambda**, the web dev club at IITH, I built a website for **Cepheid** — the Astronomy & Astrophysics Club of our campus.

This project was a solo effort, and I decided to use **Hugo (a static site generator)** to make content management super easy for non-tech folks. The idea was that club members could update their own blogs and projects using simple Markdown files — no coding needed.

Although the club didn’t end up actively maintaining the site, the process of building it taught me a lot. I had to learn **Go from scratch** just to get Hugo working the way I wanted — and that alone made this project a win.

It’s deployed on **Netlify**, and it’s still live!
