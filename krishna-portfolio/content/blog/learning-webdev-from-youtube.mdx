# Why I Don’t Regret Learning Web Dev From YouTube

If you asked me how I started my web development journey, the answer is simple:  
**YouTube.**

I’ve always been someone who prefers _watching_ over _reading_. Long pages of text? Not my thing.  
But videos that break things down in a clear, visual way? That’s where I thrive.

## 📺 YouTube Has Always Been My Classroom

Even before college, I was hooked on a channel called **Veritasium** — a science channel that dives into the _why_ behind the world. I probably learned more about physics, logic, and curiosity there than I did in school.

So naturally, when I joined **IIT Hyderabad** as a **Computer Science major**, I didn’t gravitate toward textbooks or professor-recommended PDFs. I went straight to YouTube.

## 💻 Learning Web Dev – My Way

When I decided to get into **web development**, I didn’t take any fancy paid courses or sign up for a bootcamp. I just... searched for the right videos and dove in.

Over time, I built my entire foundation through tutorials, walkthroughs, and creators sharing their experience. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js — it’s _all_ there if you have the **patience to find it** and the **discipline to stay curious**.

I didn’t stop at just watching, though.

## 🛠️ Projects, Clubs & The Breakthrough

Thanks to my college's **DBMS course** and the opportunity to join the **Lambda web dev club** at IITH, I started applying what I learned — building real projects, solving real problems, and learning how dev actually works in teams.

One thing led to another... and eventually, I landed an **internship**.

Not through a certificate.  
Not through a textbook.  
But through _projects_, _YouTube_, and a lot of trial and error.

## 🧠 Why I Believe in It

YouTube taught me that:

- Learning isn’t about _where_ you learn from — it’s about how curious you are
- You don’t need a formal course to start building things
- The internet is full of gold, if you know how to dig through the fluff

I don’t regret a single minute I spent watching tutorials or listening to creators explain the basics.  
It’s what got me here.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

If you're someone who loves learning visually, doesn't vibe with thick textbooks, or just wants to start building — let me say this clearly:

**YouTube can teach you everything.**  
You just need the patience to find the good stuff, and the drive to turn it into _your own thing_.
