# NVIDIA 50 Series: The Worst Launch I’ve Seen (And I Trusted Them)

> “I believed in NVIDIA… until the 50 series dropped.”

When Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, announced the new 50 series GPUs, I was _hyped_. He claimed the **RTX 5070** would outperform the **4090**, the previous-gen flagship. Big talk. And honestly, I bought into it — even though I wasn’t upgrading anytime soon.

But as real benchmarks rolled out, it became clear: something was off.

## Performance Letdown: 5070 vs 4090

When the 5070 benchmarks came out, the reality hit hard:

- RTX **4090** is **57% faster** than 5070
- Compare that to:
  - 3090 → 4070 = only 11% gap
  - 2080Ti → 3070 = 4% gap

This was _unheard of_ — a new mid-tier GPU trailing its prior-gen flagship by that much?

## The 5080 Money Trap

Then came the 5080 — with a **$999 MSRP**, and a spec sheet that felt intentionally underpowered. Almost like NVIDIA wanted to push people toward the **$2000 RTX 5090** instead.

The catch? Hardly anyone could even find one at MSRP.  
Retailers received only a few units, and scalpers pounced.

Prices surged across the 40 series as well. It was a mess.

## Melting Power Connectors (Yes, Really)

On top of that, the 5090’s **power connector** was reportedly **melting** due to power draw issues.

How is this even real in 2025?

## Follow the Money: It’s Not About Gaming Anymore

Let’s talk revenue.

- Gaming makes up only **12.96%** of NVIDIA’s income
- Meanwhile, **83.26%** comes from the **AI market**

So yeah, even if we gamers are mad, it barely matters to NVIDIA’s bottom line. And that’s the problem.

## Final Thoughts

I used to trust NVIDIA to bring the best to gamers.  
Now it feels like we’re an afterthought — just another market share.

The 50 series launch?  
A shiny reminder that sometimes, hype is just hype.
